As Game Developer I wish to create games that agitate people, teaches them or awakens their inner child again. Currently I'm just trying to get anything done in this domain, though.

Currently learning to work with Unity and creating assets with Blender. Was working with Unreal Engine 4 in the past but switched to unity. Why? Because.

If you want to see some work, you can follow me on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/le_chronicc/) channel where I try to post some screenshots from time to time.

My biggest inspiration is **Black & White** and I hope some day I can create something similar (of course in a team).

#### Projects

##### 3D Battle Chess (Working Title)

I want to revive Battle Chess with nice graphics. This project is mainly to learn all the processes since it contains like everything a 3D game needs nowadays (I believe).

* **Status:** Paused
* **Phase:** Implementation

##### Flying Warrior (Working Title)

A smaller side project where I learn how to create a top-down shooter.

* **Status:** In Progress
* **Phase:** Prototyping
