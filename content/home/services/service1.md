As DevOps Engineer I love designing and creating automated pipelines which build, test, release and deploy software products into any type of environment. I also love to inspect available setups and fix stuff.

### Service Offers

* Collecting and analyzing requirements.
* Creating pipeline concepts from build to rollout.
* Setting up automated* pipelines.
* Developing microservices or tools to support the build process if needed.
* Teaching and creating documentation on how to use the pipeline.
* Inspecting and fixing existing setups.

\* Automation will happen where is possible. Not all processes can be automated in a manageable time. Technological advancements may provide new and better ways of automating such processes in the future.

#### Knowledge Reacquisition

If you have a setup running and don't understand how to maintain or work with it, you can book me to inspect your running systems. I can create a documentation on how the setup is configured and how to maintain it.

For this to work I will need to talk to your employees and I will need access into you infrastructure as well as your source code (depending on what I should inspect). Given these I can combine the information to reconstruct the bigger picture.

I will happily sign an NDA to keep secret about my findings and I usually forget most of the stuff after some weeks.
