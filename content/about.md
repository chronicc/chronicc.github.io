Hi, I am Thomas - a curious nerd that likes to learn new stuff every day.

Since I was a child, I was working with computers and thus have a natural understanding of how things work in the digital world. New technologies are like sequels to me as I can understand them easily and create bridges to old technologies. I like automating things and thus have developed a tendency to work as a DevOps Engineer the last years.

I also like everything that has to do with creating stuff and thus I create stuff. Currently my biggest motivation is creating video games and 3d assets. Maybe printing 3D stuff in the future.

Apart from this I'm also interested in improving communication and creating better work athmosphere and processes. I dislike hierarchy and I believe in the revolution of the individual to take more responsibility inside it's domain. I also believe in the creation of strong networks that rely on affection and interest.

I am always looking forward to learn of new projects. So if you want to work with me, I am happy to hear from you!

Also let's create a better world together!
